# Executables
The subfolders of this directory contain complete program executables or
complete program installs, which I use elsewhere on the computer. Programs may
be accessed directly, or moved onto the host machine during the setup process.

For the most part, this directory is temporary. I aim to have all programs
downloaded fresh as part of the install script. However, I may use this method
temporarily, or for older programs whose installers are no longer hosted
elsewhere. 


## Contents:
* bfg - A program for cleaning github repos.
* k2pdfopt - A program for manipulating and concatenating pdf files.
